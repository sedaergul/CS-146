# CS-146
The repository contains programming assignments that have been completed in this class. CS 146 is an upper division class that teaches the different data structures and algorithms commonly used Computer Science, as well as concepts associated with these subjects. Data structures, algorithms, and subjects include (but not limited to):
* Sorting algorithms (Insertion, Quick, Merge, Heap, Linear, etc), their runtimes, and analysis.
* Data structures (MaxHeaps, Hash Tables, Trees, etc), their methods, and analysis.
* Basis of computational complexity theory such as understanding problems categorized as P, NP, NP-hardness, etc. 
* Understanding time complexities and determining what complexity a program/method runs in. 
* Using Discrete Mathematics to prove or disprove time complexities. 
The class is instructed by Java, and programs are written in Java.
